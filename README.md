# RAILFENCE-CIPHER USING AN ADJACENCY LIST
An illustration of how Data structures can be used to encrypt and decrypt data using a classical transposition cipher-Railfence cipher 
A fun project created to demonstrate the usage of adjacency list in the
encryption and decryption of a plaintext using Railfence Cipher


RAILFENCE CIPHER:

	A classical transposition cipher that is, the charcaters in the plaintext are
	arranged in a certain order,(here arranged in a zig zag pattern)
	and the cipher text is produced by popping all the elements in
	the adjacency list row-wise.
	The number of rows is to be chosen by the user (generally 3/4/5)

INPUT FORMAT:


	1. user is asked to select either of the two choices (Encryption or Decryption)
 
	2. based on the choice,redirects the user to that particular choice
 
	3. If a plaintext is being encrypted then the user is asked to
	   enter the plaintext which is to be encrypted, the encrypted
	   text is then displayed on the terminal
    
	4.If a ciphertext is being decrypted then the user is asked to
	  enter the ciphertext to be decrypted, the palintext is
	  displayed on the terminal
   
	5. The user has to enter the key,remeber the same key value is
 
	   used for both decryption and encryption as in the case of a
	   classical cipher.
